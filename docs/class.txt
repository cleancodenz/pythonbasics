Built in class attributes :

    Every Python class keeps following built-in attributes and they can be accessed using dot operator like any other attribute âˆ’

        __dict__: Dictionary containing the class's namespace.

        __doc__: Class documentation string or none, if undefined.

        __name__: Class name.

        __module__: Module name in which the class is defined. This attribute is "__main__" in interactive mode.

        __bases__: A possibly empty tuple containing the base classes, in the order of their occurrence in the base class list.
Enumlating container types:
    
    object.__getitem__(self, key)
        Called to implement evaluation of self[key]. For sequence types, the accepted keys should be integers and slice objects. Note that the special interpretation of negative indexes (if the class wishes to emulate a sequence type) is up to the __getitem__() method. If key is of an inappropriate type, TypeError may be raised; if of a value outside the set of indexes for the sequence (after any special interpretation of negative values), IndexError should be raised. For mapping types, if key is missing (not in the container), KeyError should be raised.
